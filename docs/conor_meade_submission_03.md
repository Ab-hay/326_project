For this project, I contributed to several aspects. Specifically, I added models, url mappings, and views for the map portion of the project. This will be one of the key features for our final submission.

I also worked on the tailored view on the home page for users who are logged in and logged out. Users who are logged in will see a slightly different home page and have more capabilities than a logged out user.

Lastly, I did the team write up for this project that outlined our design overview, successes/problems, and goals for our final project submission. This aspect required a lot of communication with team members to make sure all our goals aligned and to help outline what we accomplished on this project.
