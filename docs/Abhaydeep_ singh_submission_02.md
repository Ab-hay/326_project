My basic contribution include: implementation of basic skeleton with the homepage views and models. I contributed to several aspects of this project. Specifically, I worked upon the user login/logout functionality which supports both admin and normal users. 

Made a user model for User to register. Setup AppConfig in app.py. Added login, logout, register, members in url.py for login functionality.Added HTML templates for all the login/logout, home page, Members page, and the nav bar. 
Made base and index templated and put some static HTML content.

Lastly, added Some of the custom CSS.
