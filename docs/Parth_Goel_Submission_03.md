For this project, I contributed to the team in several ways to make sure the application is running properly.

I helped in devising the login/logout functionality and how it would tie the users to the existing database and allow them to view other members, and helped developing the register page.
I contributed in creating the design of the homepage and more importantly the layout of where the information would be and how the links to each page would be displayed.
I also helped in creating the submission video and in creating the team submission write-up making sure we adhered to the grading rubric.
