For this project I made several contributions. First, I went over the requirements and made sure that we were working towards meeting all of them. 

I also helped with adding user views to the project.  Specifically, I added the requirement to be logged in in order to be able to access the members list.  
If the visitor is not logged in, they will be redirected to the homepage and asked to log in.  

Finally, I helped to create the video and explain the functionality of the new features we added to our app.
