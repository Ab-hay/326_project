I contributed several aspects to this project.  I created the FoodPost and FoodComment models in models.py, and took input from team members on what information those models should contain.  I also registered these models with the admin site in admin.py

I also created the views and template for displaying Users, Posts, and Comment both as a list and as a detailed view of individual Posts and Comments.  Additionally, I added url mapping for both of these in urls.py, in the form of listview and detailview for both posts and comments.

I also assisted in writing init.py as well as helped in troubleshooting bugs that occured.
