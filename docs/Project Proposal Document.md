# Innovative Idea

Our application will be focused on giving student and faculty at UMass a way of finding free and reduced price food on campus. Students are consistently in a position where they are hungry and in need of a food break. Options like going to a dining hall, grab n' go, food truck etc. may not always be the most practical option based on factors like cost and time. UMass vultures will allow students to be given a running feed of places on campus where free food is being served or there is reduced price food.

We will be looking to incorporate ways to share these updates on Facebook and Twitter to allow for a wider audience. Also, we will be trying to have the options for free/reduced food show up on a map of campus so users can see exactly where they need to go.

# Important Data

UMass Vultures will have a page with a form to fill out a new entry for food. This form will include options like: time period, user, location, type of food, etc. Also, for each individual post we will have options to upvote and downvote individual entries. Upvotes can be used to indicate posts that are trustworthy, high-quality food, consistently available food, and any other reason that a user/post would merit gratification. Downvotes can be used to help filter bad and unwanted posts as well as posts unrelated to the goal of UMass Vultures.

Additional types of data we will be using will be a running count of users aggregated upvote/downvote score. This total score can be used as a metric for trustworthy and consistent users and vice versa. Using Google's API for the map portion, we will also be keeping track of the distance from as user's current location to the free food spot. Also, we can include an entry list/drop down menu for different food options to cut down on time of creating an entry. As more users use the web application, this list can become more and more defined

# User Interface

**still need screen shots

**Home-** We will have links to all our pages, a login button as well. There will also be an option to login with Facebook/Google


**What's New (Name pending)-** Users will be able to post what their food is that they are giving away, upvote/downvote and comments for each post, also a link to the 'Map' page for each post


**User Man-** A detailed view of the individual view, karma score based on their upvotes/downvotes of their post


**Map-** A detailed view of the UMass campus with exact locations of where the free and unwanted food is


**Form Maker-** A page for creating a post on food that can be vulture'd. Options will include: time, location, kind of food, etc
