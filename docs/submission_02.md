# Overview
Our application aims to give students and faculty at UMass a way to access free or reduced price food. We will have a running feed of posts and a map to display where and what the food is on campus. Users of the site will have an aggregated upvote/downvote metric that will help in determining the reliability of the post.

As for changes from project 1, we have made the change from using React.js to Django as Django falls more in line with the goals of the course. We are currently working through configuring Django and Python as it relates to creating our web application.

# Problems/Successes
Our main problem in this project was pivoting from using react.js to Django. We are early on enough in the process of creating our site that it was not a huge issue. However, we did have to take time to familiarize ourselves with Django/Python when it comes to designing our site.  We were still able to use our HTML and CSS files from the previous project so we did not have to completely start from scratch. Another issue we had was on the communication front and finding times in our schedules where we would all be free to work on the project. For upcoming projects, we will have to improve on staying on top of things and maintaining communication throughout the entire process.

For Successes, we did a solid job implementing our model in this project. Much of our design overview for the UMass vultures app that involves a Person, FoodComment, and FoodPost all translated well when it came to creating and implementing our diagram. The video also came together well and we were able to properly describe our model. Also, the example code proved to be very helpful when implementing our own site. In many cases, we did not have to change very much and it was nice having a good foundation in the examples from lecture
