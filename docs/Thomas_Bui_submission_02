The Post page, which is where users will submit information about events. 
In the future, Information submitted here will be added to the database. 

The other page that was added was the feed, which is where all the user submitted information will be displayed. 
The feed page has a list of posts. When one is clicked, the user is taken to the detailed page for the post.

For Part 2, I implemented the url mappings for both pages. 
Then, the html files from project 1 were brought over. 
Finally, elements from the models were connected to the template in the views.py file.
