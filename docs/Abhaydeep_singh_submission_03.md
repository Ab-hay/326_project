Worked on URL mapping and user models with access restricted pages and rendered User info to the memberâ€™s only page, 
Added all the required project dependencies to the required directory. Worked on the nav bar with basic HTML templates(base, navbar homepage) and mock user pages. 

Worked on User view classes: LoginView, LogoutView, RegisterView, members view.
Added Django debug toolbar on the project debug tool. I did this by adding some snippets to the url.py under the
vultures repository 

Lastly explained the user story in the video.
